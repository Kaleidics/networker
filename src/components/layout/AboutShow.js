                    Professional Social Networking became the future of passive recruiting w/ LinkedIn heading the way. Passive sourcing became a recruiting staple in the HR field. Recruiters in the HR field were tired of being spammed resumes through job boards. Users started to develop a "spray and pray" approach to applying for jobs, which became the bane to recruiters everywhere. The internet solved the quantity issue regarding resumes with accessible job boards - now we needed to
                    solve the quality issue. LinkedIn gave recruiters the ability to source candidates without candidates applying for jobs. It was also an amazing backdoor reference check, just in case the candidate was lying on their resume. LinkedIn's position as the "professional" social network gave them immense leverage as their userbase grew. It's design granted them the "network effects" perk and it's userbase grew exponentially. It's large userbase granted them user data and the
                    smart companies wanted data-driven results. While LinkedIn experienced rapid growth and innovation, it failed to capture user engagement like it's social media contemporaries like Facebook, Instagram, Snap, or Twitter. If LinkedIn solved the issue of user engagement, it's Marketing Solution (ads) would have saved it from failing in 2016. It's a useful site but lacked the addiction quality. LinkedIn relied heavily on its Talent Solution suite to carry its revenue, but
                    that leads to problems on the global scale. LinkedIn found barriers w/ Linkedin clones in Europe (viadeo & xing) and China (liepen).

                    Other professional networking sites attempted to exist during LinkedIn's reign but fizzled out. Brightfuse.com by Monster tried becoming a LinkedIn clone. Brachout failed by building its platform on Facebook apps. Visual Path used "email" as a way to gain business connections. JobFox straight-up sucked due to bad leadership. The only professional networking companies that survived during this age were the companies that focused on a niche market or demographic like
                    viadeo, xing, and liepen.
