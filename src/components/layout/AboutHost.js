                    Julian Abeleda is an avid Tech/Silicon Valley fan. He first learned about this space by attending the ASCEND 2018 conference. This conference changed Julian's life because he met three professionals in the Tech / VC world: Justin Kan (Founder of Justin.tv, and Twitch.tv), Daniel Kan (Founder of Cruise Automation), and Emily Chang (Reporter on Bloomberg Tech). While he became interested in the tech / VC world, most of his friends thought it was boring as fuck. If you
                    want to contact Julian Abeleda, please reach him via twitter at https://twitter.com/fromnetwrkr.
